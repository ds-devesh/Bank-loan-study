# Loan Default Prediction
This repository showcases an end-to-end project focused on predicting loan defaults using a combination of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The project addresses a critical challenge faced by financial institutions: identifying high-risk applicants while ensuring capable customers are not rejected. The goal is to analyze patterns, gain insights, and implement predictive models to support informed decision-making in loan approvals.

* Project Description
Imagine you're a data analyst at a financial institution that specializes in lending various types of loans. The company faces two major risks:

* Losing Business: If capable applicants are rejected.
Financial Loss: If risky applicants are approved and default on their loans.
To mitigate these risks, we analyze a dataset of loan applications. The dataset includes customer attributes, loan attributes, and outcomes related to payment behavior, such as:

Customers with payment difficulties (e.g., late payments beyond a certain threshold).
Customers who paid their installments on time.
Loan Outcomes in the Dataset:
Approved: Loan application was approved.
Cancelled: Customer canceled the application.
Refused: Loan application was rejected.
Unused Offer: Loan was approved but unused.

Business Objectives:
The primary aim of the project is to identify patterns and key factors that influence loan defaults. These insights can help the company:

-Deny loans to high-risk applicants.
-Reduce loan amounts for borderline applicants.
-Adjust interest rates for risky applicants.

*Project Workflow
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
A. Handling Missing Data:
Identified and visualized missing data across variables.
Imputed missing values using statistical methods (e.g., mean or median).
Graph Used: Bar chart to show the proportion of missing values per variable.

B. Identifying Outliers:
Detected outliers in numerical variables using interquartile range (IQR) and statistical thresholds.
Visualized outliers using box plots for better insights.
Graph Used: Box plots to highlight the outliers in key variables.

C. Addressing Data Imbalance:
Assessed class imbalance in the dataset, especially for binary classification problems.
Calculated proportions and visualized the distribution of target variables.
Graph Used: Pie charts and bar charts to depict class imbalance.

D. Univariate, Segmented Univariate, and Bivariate Analysis:
Performed univariate analysis to study individual variable distributions.
Conducted segmented univariate and bivariate analyses to compare variable distributions across different scenarios.
Graphs Used: Histograms, stacked bar charts, grouped bar charts, and scatter plots.

E. Correlation Analysis:
Analyzed correlations between features and the target variable for different scenarios.
Identified top indicators of loan default based on correlation coefficients.
Graph Used: Heatmaps to visualize the strongest correlations.

2. Machine Learning (ML) Models
To predict loan defaults, the following machine learning models were trained and evaluated:

A. Logistic Regression:
A baseline linear model used for binary classification.
Achieved 91.5% accuracy on the test data.
B. Random Forest Classifier:
An ensemble model providing robust predictions.
Achieved 91.4% accuracy, with feature importance analysis to highlight key predictors.
C. Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy was calculated for both models.
Confusion matrices were generated to evaluate prediction performance.
D. Feature Importance:
Visualized the importance of features in predicting loan defaults using bar charts.

*Results and Insights
-Identified patterns in customer behavior and loan attributes influencing defaults.
-Determined the most significant variables, such as income level, loan amount, and credit history.
-Built robust predictive models with over 91% accuracy to assist in decision-making.
